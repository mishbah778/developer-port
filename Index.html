            <p>Manuel Gallo Espinoza, 59, shot and killed Byron Carreño, his partner in an English language school in
                Loja, Ecuador, on July 2, the reports said, citing “investigators.” He also shot two other partners and
                his pet before turning the gun on himself after a dispute about the management of the school, the
                reports said.Efforts to reach prosecutors in Ecuador were unsuccessful, and the Union County
                Prosecutor’s Office was not immediately able to confirm the reports of Gallo Espinoza’s death. However,
                several people who know Gallo Espinoza verified his identity by widely-circulated photographs.</p>

                <p>TEAM CAPTAIN page was created on February 21, 2020.. 2020 to 2021 was a short time but
                    Alhamdulillah our achievement was so good. TEAM CAPTAIN, in 2021 we achieved a partnership with
                    Facebook and it was a very happy moment. TEAM CAPTAIN 17,300 subscribers' YouTube channel was
                    hacked. But TEAM CAPTAIN backed up their channel but lost their monetization. Since then, YouTube
                    has
                    not been so focused and then he focus on his page fully. But another bad news for the page comes on
                    June 8, 2021. The TEAM CAPTAIN Facebook partner page was hacked and all of us who were admins
                    were removed. There was a time when the thought of canceling the page came to mind but TEAM
                    CAPTAIN always said-“ One thing CAPTAIN never gives Up”. TEAM CAPTAIN means Mishbah has never
                    gives up. He tries his best and then backs up his page with the help of another popular Bangladeshi
                    streamer NOOBOSS. </p>

                <p>This was the Team Captain's DARK CHAPTER. Another bad day for TEAM CAPTAIN
                    comes when TEAM CAPTAIN loses their official partner. But there is no such thing as one who trusts
                    in
                    Allah and works, Allah never disappoints him TEAM CAPTAIN gets their partner back. They got the
                    partner
                    with the PUBGM. They lost their partner with the PUBGM and got back with the PUBGM. Let's make one
                    thing clear here. Bangladesh PUBGM is banned for losing partner with PUBGM, due to which stream
                    viewers are reduced and page reaches down by down. After going through so much, the TEAM CAPTAIN
                    gets its partner back. Team Captain History is the result of the hard work of a successful gaming
                    streamer. This is the result of the hard work of a man who does not give up. Today's TEAM CAPTAIN
                    has
                    thousands of supporters who have been supporting him from the beginning till now and one again said
                    “CAPTAIN NEVER GIVES UP”</p>
